## 💎 Items (important)

<!-- This is important to filter by Id, to recheck it and get translations!
✍️ Write item ids or urls for example: https://www.wowhead.com/item=177698/ -->

## 🗃️ Class or Sub-Class

<!-- ✍️ Difficult to filter, for example "Consumable": https://www.wowhead.com/item=177698/ -->

## 📜 Tooltip

<!-- ✍️ Bad, but works, for example "Queen's Conservatory": https://www.wowhead.com/item=177698/ -->
